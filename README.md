# Intrcpt

A program to play a game similar to Atari games. Spec. : tensorflow, python 3.6.7

In this game, objects are falling in different angles and directions, and the agent's goal is to intercept them using a turret. every state consists of the feedback given by the environment after each action. the feedback consists of the turret's angle, object's locations, interception's locations and total score. there are four possible actions for the agent to choose.

I have decided to try and implement the program using Q-deep-learning, loss and gradient descent calculations.
